# pyfup

Basic file upload WSGI application (python 3.x)

This script brings up a simple_server from python's wsgiref
package and runs a really simple web application on it.
It allows to upload any file using multipart/form-data encoding.
Don't use it in production environment as it has not been
reviewed for security issues, however it's handy for ad-hoc
file transfers between machines over HTTP protocol.


## usage

    python fup.py 8000
